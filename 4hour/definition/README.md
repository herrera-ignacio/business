## 1.Calculations and Comparisions

### New Rich vs Deferrers

#### New Rich

* To have others work for you.
* To prevent work for work's sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (_minimum effective load_).
* To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.
* To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be.
* To be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. Own the trains and have someone else ensure they run on time.
* To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams, timelins and steps.
* To have more quality and less clutter, huge financial reserves but recognize that most material wants are justifications for spending time on things that don't really matter.
* To thing big but ensure payday comes every day. __Cash flow first, big payday second__.
* To have freedom from doing that which you dislike but also freedom to resolve and persue your dreams without reverting to work for work's sake.

#### Deferrers

* To work yourself.
* To work when you want to.
* To retire early or young.
* To buy all the things you want to have.
* To be the boss instead of the employee.
* To make a ton of money.
* To have more.
* Reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold.
* To have freedom from doing that which you dislike.

## 2. Rules that Change the Rules

* Everything popular is wrong.
* Beating the game, not playing the game.
* Challenging the status quo is not the same as being stupid.

The following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep in mind:

1. Retirement is worst-case-scenario insurance.
2. Interest and energy are cyclical.
3. Less is not laziness, focus on being productive instead of busy.
4. The timing is never right.
5. Ask for forgiveness, not permission.
6. Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses.
7. Things in excess become their opposite.
8. Money alone is not the solution.
9. Relative income is more important that absolute income.
10. Distress is bad, eustress is good.

## 3. Dodging Bullets

* Fear-setting and escapping paralysis.
* The power of pessimism, defining the nightmare.
* Conquering Fear = Defining Fear
* Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism

#### Q&A

1. Define your absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering.
2. What steps could you take to repair the damage?
3. What are the outcomes/benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios?
4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?
5. What are you putting off out of fear?
6. What is it costing oyu, financially, emotionally, and physically, to postpone action?
7. What are you waiting for?
