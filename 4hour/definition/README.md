### New Rich vs Deferrers

#### New Rich

* To have others work for you.
* To prevent work for work's sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (_minimum effective load_).
* To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.
* To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be.
* To be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. Own the trains and have someone else ensure they run on time.
* To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams, timelins and steps.
* To have more quality and less clutter, huge financial reserves but recognize that most material wants are justifications for spending time on things that don't really matter.
* To thing big but ensure payday comes every day. __Cash flow first, big payday second__.
* To have freedom from doing that which you dislike but also freedom to resolve and persue your dreams without reverting to work for work's sake.

#### Deferrers

* To work yourself.
* To work when you want to.
* To retire early or young.
* To buy all the things you want to have.
* To be the boss instead of the employee.
* To make a ton of money.
* To have more.
* Reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold.
* To have freedom from doing that which you dislike.
